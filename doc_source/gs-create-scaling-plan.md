# Step 4: Create Your Scaling Plan<a name="gs-create-scaling-plan"></a>

On the **Review and create** page, review the details of your scaling plan and choose **Create scaling plan**\. 

**Important**  
If the scaling plan detects existing scaling policies that were created from outside of the plan \(such as from another console\) for any of your resources, there is a note for that resource type\. The note states that **X scaling policies cannot be applied due to the presence of external policies**\. By default, AWS Auto Scaling does not create new target tracking scaling policies when there are external scaling policies\. You can optionally choose to allow your scaling plan to overwrite scaling policies that were created from outside of the plan and create new ones by enabling the **Replace external scaling policies** setting in the previous step\. If you choose not to replace the existing scaling policies, you can still create your scaling plan, though its status will be *ActiveWithProblems*\.

After you create your scaling plan, view the target tracking scaling policies created by AWS Auto Scaling as well as the scheduled scaling actions created for your Auto Scaling groups with predictive scaling enabled\.

The console also displays a series of graphs for each resource\. Data is visualized in a few different ways:
+ Graphs showing recent metric history data from CloudWatch\. 
+ Load forecast and capacity forecast graphs for predictive scaling based on data from AWS Auto Scaling\.

 As an example of a load forecast, the left side of the graph below demonstrates a historical load pattern, which tends to peak at the same time every day\. The right side of the graph demonstrates the load forecast generated by the scaling plan for the forecast period\.
