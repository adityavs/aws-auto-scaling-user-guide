# Step 4: Create Your Scaling Plan<a name="gs-create-scaling-plan"></a>

On the **Review and create** page, review the details of your scaling plan and choose **Create scaling plan**\. You are directed to a page that shows the status of your scaling plan\. The scaling plan can take a moment to finish being created while your resources are updated\. 

With predictive scaling, AWS Auto Scaling analyzes the history of the specified load metric from the past 14 days \(minimum of 24 hours of data is required\) to generate a forecast for two days ahead\. It then schedules scaling actions to adjust the resource capacity to match the forecast for each hour in the forecast period\. 

After the creation of the scaling plan is complete, view the scaling plan details by choosing its name from the **Scaling plans** screen\.

## \(Optional\) View Scaling Information for a Resource<a name="gs-view-resource"></a>

Use this procedure to view the scaling information created for a resource\. 

Data is presented in the following ways:
+ Graphs showing recent metric history data from CloudWatch\. 
+ Predictive scaling graphs showing load forecasts and capacity forecasts based on data from AWS Auto Scaling\.
+ A table that lists all the predictive scaling actions scheduled for the resource\.

As an example of a load forecast, the left side of the graph below demonstrates a historical load pattern, which tends to peak at the same time every day\. The right side of the graph demonstrates the load forecast generated by the scaling plan for the forecast period\.
